# e-commerce website
The MVC (Model - Controller - View) based web project I developed with Visual Studio.
My project consists of the page where electronic products are shared on the main page and the other page where the site manager (admin panel) can be added to the product and information about the products can be entered. 
The database I have created for the Model that is in the MVC structure (T-sql) is in the categories of products and admins. 
These categories add, update and delete as desired. 
On the main page, there are product detail buttons for the products, the categories of products and the details of the products.
